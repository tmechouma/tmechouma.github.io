      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
	  <div align="justify">
       A highly skilled NLP expert and passionate AI researcher, driven by a mission to design and develop state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (LLMs) that transcend symbolic surface forms to semotize conceptsâ€”capturing meaning through grounded, perceptual representations. My research vision lies in bridging the gap between linguistic symbols and real-world semantics by fusing vision and language at the conceptual level, creating truly intelligent systems that understand, reason, and interact like humans.
	   <br><br>
       I integrate cutting-edge technologies including Transformers, LLMs variants, and powerful toolkits like <strong>LangChain, Semantic Kernel, Haystack, LiteLLM, and LlamaIndex </strong> to build retrieval-augmented generation <strong>(RAG)</strong> systems and intelligent agents capable of real-world problem solving. My multimodal pipeline involves <strong>CLIP, BLIP-2, Kosmos-2, and Flamingo </strong>, tightly woven with language processing layers to enable deep contextual understanding across text, image, and video modalities.
	   <br><br>
	   With hands-on expertise in vector databases <strong>(FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)</strong>, I implement semantic indexing and grounded concept linking using external knowledge bases and latent spaces derived from vision modelsâ€”an approach that redefines the nature of understanding and inference in AI.
       <br><br>
	   Proficient in Python, <strong> Neo4j, Mongodb, apache Spark, SQL, NoSQL </strong> and modern DevOps/MLOps practices <strong>(Docker, GitHub Actions, MLflow, Terraform, Kubernetes)</strong>, I deploy scalable, production-ready AI services in Azure, GCP, and AWS cloud ecosystems. My architecture philosophy embraces CI/CD, data-centric AI, and research-to-deployment alignment, ensuring that cutting-edge insights seamlessly translate into enterprise-grade solutions.
       An enthusiastic collaborator and lifelong learner, I thrive at the intersection of research and application, constantly pushing the frontiers of multimodal cognition, grounded meaning, and neurosymbolic AI. Iâ€™m on a mission to contribute to the next generation of LLMs that can see, reason, and communicate with conceptual depthâ€”not just linguistic fluency.<span class="emoji">ðŸ§ </span>

        <li><strong>VLG-BERT</strong>: Towards Better Interpretability in LLMs through Visual and Linguistic Grounding â€“ <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.nlp4dh-1.47/" target="_blank">NLP4DH 2025 - NAACL 2025</a></li>
        <p><div align="justify">This paper explores We present VLG-BERT, a novel LLM model conceived to improve language meaning encoding. VLG-BERT provides deeper insights about meaning encoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on linguistic and real-world semantics. It uses syntactic dependencies as a form of ground truth to supervise the learning process of word representations. VLG-BERT incorporates visual latent representations from pre-trained vision models and their corresponding labels. A vocabulary of 10k tokens corresponding to so-called concrete words is built by extending the set of ImageNet labels. The extension is based on synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms from WordNet. A lookup table for this vocabulary is then used to initialize the embedding matrix during training, rather than random initialization. This multimodal grounding provides a stronger semantic foundation for encoding the meaning of words. Its architecture aligns seamlessly with foundational theories from across the cognitive sciences. The integration of visual and linguistic grounding makes VLG-BERT consistent with many cognitive theories. Our approach contributes to the ongoing effort to create models that bridge the gap between language and vision, making them more aligned with how humans understand and interpret the world. Experiments on text classification have shown excellent results compared to BERT Base. </div></p>
	<li><strong>SCABERT</strong>: Syntactic Knowledge as a Ground Truth Supervisor via Augmented Lagrange Multipliers â€“ <em>ICICT 2025</em></li>
        <p><div align="justify">This paper introduces Syntax-Constraint-Aware BERT, a novel variant of BERT designed to inject syntactic knowledge into the attention mechanism using augmented Lagrange multipliers. The model employs syntactic dependencies as a form of ground truth to supervise the learning process of word representation, thereby ensuring that syntactic structure exerts an influence on the model's word representations. The application of augmented Lagrangian optimisation enables the imposition of constraints on the attention mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of syntactic relationships. This approach involves the augmentation of the standard BERT architecture through the modification of the prediction layer. The objective is to predict an adjacency matrix that encodes words' syntactic relationships in place of the masked tokens. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the injection of syntactic knowledge leads to improved performance in comparison to BERT in terms of training time and also on AG News text classification as a downstream task. By combining the flexibility of deep learning with structured linguistic knowledge, we introduce a merge between bottom-up and top-down approaches. Furthermore, Syntax- Constraint-Aware BERT enhances the interpretability and performance of Transformer-based models. </div></p>
	<li><strong>lingBERT</strong>:LingBERT, Linguistic Knowledge Injection into Attention Mechanism Based on a Hybrid Masking Strategy <a href="https://www.proceedings.com/content/078/078866webtoc.pdf" target="_blank">ICMLA 2024</a></li>      
	<p><div align="justify">In this paper, we propose lingBERT, a transformers based language model. We present two architectures of lingBERT based on hybrid masking strategy. Both models are inspired by BERT base. Our model introduces linguistic knowledge (syntactic dependencies ) injection into attention mechanisms. Models like BERT employ random masking of tokens during training, which can lead to inefficiencies in capturing syntactic and semantic dependencies. To address this, our method uses two masking strategies. The first one masks words with syntactic dependencies. The second one uses a low percentage of randomly masked words. Resulted tokens from both strategies are then handed over tow proposed architectures of lingBERT. This strategy ensures that linguistic relationships are preserved and learned more effectively. Additionally, we maintain a low randomness ratio of masked tokens to avoid overfitting and enhance the model generalization. Through comprehensive experiments and evaluations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in capturing context, leading to better performance across various NLP tasks. Furthermore, our approach affords an interpretability about our model inner workings throughout the learning process. This work offers a new direction toward knowledge injection into attention-mechanism based models, leading to advancing the capabilities of language understanding systems. </div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">Dot-Product based attention mechanism is among recent attention mechanisms. It showed an outstanding performance with BERT. In this paper, we propose a dependency-parsing mask to reinforce the padding mask, at the multi-head attention units. Padding mask, is already used to filter padding positions. The proposed mask, aims to improve BERT attention filter. The conducted experiments, show that BERT performs better with the proposed mask.</div></p>
